# i18n-dom

The most worry-free i18n tool in the browser.

## Introduction

i18n-dom implements functions based on text nodes, so you only need to initialize the tool. No need to modify node properties, no need to introduce translated api.

When you add nodes or modify nodes, the tool will silently convert for you in the background, you only need to use your default language to develop.

‚≠êÔ∏è No need to assign a separate key to each text;
‚≠êÔ∏è Very small, only 673B after compression;
‚≠êÔ∏è Independent of framework, based on web api, can be used in browser environment.

## Install

```sh
npm install i18n-dom
```

## Load from CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/i18n-dom/dist/i18n-dom.min.js"></script>
```

You can access I18n through the global class I18nDOM

## Usage

```js
import I18nDOM from "i18n-dom";

const i18n = new I18nDOM({
  htmlLanguage: "en", // The language in which the web page is written
  resource: {
    en: ["Hello World!", "Second paragraph of text"],
    zh: ["‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ", "Á¨¨‰∫åÊÆµÊñáÊú¨"],
    ru: ["–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç, –º–∏—Ä!", "–í—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –∞–±–∑–∞—Ü —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–∞"],
  },
});
```

Just use your default language normally in your code

```html
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<script>
  i18n.changeLanguage("zh"); // Change the language to zh
  document.querySelector("span").innerText = "Second paragraph of text"; // "Á¨¨‰∫åÊÆµÊñáÊú¨" will automatically appear on the page!
</script>
```

That's all!

## API

### i18n.changeLanguage(lang: string)

Change the language displayed on the page to lang.

## Advanced use

üêë If you run into problems or need more advanced features, check out the Macro section below;
üêë This tool will automatically detect the language used by the user, and will also automatically save the language selected by the user. If you need to customize the detection function, please check the following Detection section below.

## Detection

At present, the language selected by the user will be saved in `localStorage.i18nDOMLng` by default, and the custom configuration is under development

## Macro

Macros are mainly used to solve some more complex functions or problems, such as synonyms, dynamic replacement text, etc.

### I18NDOM_KEY

Fix translation errors caused by synonyms.

It is more common for the same text to have different meanings, such as animal:

```js
const i18n = new I18nDOM({
  htmlLanguage: "en",
  resource: {
    en: ["animal", "animal"],
    zh: ["Âä®Áâ©", "ÈáéÂÖΩ"],
    ru: ["–∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ", "–∑–≤–µ—Ä—å"],
  },
});
```

Because there are two identical animals in the English list, there will be an error when switching languages.

The first solution, recommended, is not to use the same words, but to use synonyms instead, e.g.

```js
const i18n = new I18nDOM({
  htmlLanguage: "en",
  resource: {
    en: ["animal", "beast"],
    zh: ["Âä®Áâ©", "ÈáéÂÖΩ"],
    ru: ["–∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ", "–∑–≤–µ—Ä—å"],
  },
});
```

The second way is to use I18NDOM_KEY. Add a special tag `I18NDOM_KEY + KeyName` to each language list for synonyms, e.g.

```js
const i18n = new I18nDOM({
  htmlLanguage: "en",
  resource: {
    en: ["animal", "animal I18NDOM_KEY anyString"],
    zh: ["Âä®Áâ©", "ÈáéÂÖΩ I18NDOM_KEY anyString"],
    ru: ["–∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ", "–∑–≤–µ—Ä—å I18NDOM_KEY anyString"],
  },
});
```

Then use the modified text in the code, the display will automatically hide the macro related content.

```html
<span>animal</span> <span>animal I18NDOM_KEY anyString</span>
```

### I18NDOM_DATA

There is dynamic data in the string.

In situations such as displaying user information, you may need to dynamically replace certain words in a sentence.

First, use the symbol `%` to wrap the content that needs to be dynamically replaced:

```js
const i18n = new I18nDOM({
  htmlLanguage: "en",
  resource: {
    en: ["Welcome %name%! Your age is %age%"],
    zh: ["Ê¨¢Ëøé%name%ÔºÅ‰Ω†ÁöÑÂπ¥ÈæÑÊòØ%age%"],
    ru: ["–î–æ–±—Ä–æ –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å, %–∏–º—è%! –í–∞—à –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç: %age%"],
  },
});
```

Then use I18NDOM_DATA to insert the data content in the code, dynamically replace the content behind `name=` and `age=`

```html
<span
  >Welcome %name%! Your age is %age% I18NDOM_DATA name=Jay Chou I18NDOM_DATA
  age=18</span
>
```

When you use some data-responsive frameworks like React, you need to use some hacks to combine the text into a node to use this macro, the following is used in react:

```html
<span
  >{"Welcome %name%! Your age is %age% I18NDOM_DATA name=${name} I18NDOM_DATA
  age=${age}"}</span
>
```

### I18NDOM_IGNORE

Sometimes you want a piece of text not to be affected by this tool, you can use this macro, it will prohibit all translation and interpolation operations, and only remove the macro-related content from the text when it is displayed

```js
const i18n = new I18nDOM({
  htmlLanguage: "en", // The language in which the web page is written
  resource: {
    en: ["Hello World!"],
    zh: ["‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ"],
    ru: ["–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç, –º–∏—Ä!"],
  },
});
```

The text below will not be automatically translated following language changes

```html
<span>Hello World! I18NDOM_IGNORE</span>
```
